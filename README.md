# Visualization
This is my protfolio of visiualization projects.
I have hands-on experince with translating abstract data into easily-digestible and highly-visual dashboard applications. This repository focuses on data visualization techniques implemented using the R programming language and PySpark.
 
Table of contents: 
1. Visualizing large data sets using GGPlots : Crime_Incidents_analysis.Rmd,  Analysis using iris dataset.Rmd
2. show statitical data by combing GPS data in visiualization : sales_rep.rmd
3. Defines a range of hyperparameters for the random forest classifier. Fits the pipeline model to the training dataset, makes predictions on the testing dataset :spark_visualization_classification.ipynb
